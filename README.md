ISIDA
=====

What is Isida?
--------------

Isida is a small customizable tool that automatically checks and (in 
future releases) corrects network devices configuration according to 
specified rules. The project itself was started as automatic tool to keep 
settings correct on 3000+ different L2 switches in ISP's access network. 
It may be useful in small and medium networks that don't have any other 
centralized management tools. It requires bash, net-SNMP framework, 
expect and cron as poller, it has nothing to compile within itself, it is 
just a bunch of shell-scripts and some .conf files to keep this thing 
working.
